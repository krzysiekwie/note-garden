Welcome to my digital gardenâ€”a curated space where ideas, notes, and reflections come together. As a technical writer with a background in linguistics and translation, I use this garden to capture evolving thoughts, tools, and techniques in my field. While much of what you'll find here is private, each note builds on the other, helping me refine my approach to writing, documenting, and communicating technical concepts clearly and effectively.

Outside of work, I delve into photography and pen-and-paper roleplaying games, both of which find their way into my notes. Whether it's experimenting with storytelling mechanics or capturing the perfect frame through the lens, this garden is also a space for creativity and exploration.
