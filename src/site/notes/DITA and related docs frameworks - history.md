Here's a detailed year-by-year history of the **Darwin Information Typing Architecture (DITA)** and other related documentation frameworks. DITA is an XML-based architecture for authoring, producing, and delivering technical information. It provides a set of guidelines and best practices for writing and structuring technical content.

### Year-by-Year History of DITA and Related Documentation Frameworks

### Early 1990s: Origins and Predecessors

- **Early 1990s**: Before DITA was formally conceived, several markup languages and frameworks were being developed to standardize technical documentation. Notable predecessors include:
    - **DocBook**: An XML standard for writing structured documents, particularly technical documentation.
    - **SGML (Standard Generalized Markup Language)**: The precursor to XML, widely used for complex documentation needs.

### 1999: Beginnings of DITA

- **1999**: The development of DITA began internally at IBM. The goal was to create a modular documentation architecture that could support topic-based authoring, reuse, and single-source publishing.

        - **Keyref (Key References)**: Introduced a key-based addressing mechanism for managing reusable content.
        - **Subject Scheme Maps**: Enabled controlled vocabularies and taxonomy management.
        - **Learning and Training Specialization**: Added support for creating learning and training materials.
        - **New Domain Specializations**: Introduced new domains for machine industry and software documentation.

### 2014: DITA 1.3

- **December 2014**: **DITA 1.3** was released, featuring numerous improvements and extensions:
    
    - **Key Enhancements**:
        - **Lightweight DITA**: Aimed at simplifying DITA for less complex authoring needs, focusing on ease of use.
        - **Improved Scalability**: Enhanced features for managing large-scale content projects.
        - **New Specializations**: Added support for troubleshooting, release management, and more.
        - **Branch Filtering**: Allowed different content branches to be filtered for specific outputs.
        - **DITA 1.3 Errata** (2015): Addressed minor corrections and clarifications in the standard.

### 2018: DITA 2.0 Draft Discussions

- **2018**: Initial discussions and drafts for **DITA 2.0** began, focusing on simplifying the architecture and improving usability. Key goals included addressing feedback from the community and enhancing support for modern content delivery platforms.

### 2021: DITA 2.0 Approval

- **December 2021**: **DITA 2.0** was officially approved, marking a significant evolution of the standard:
    
    - **Key Features**:
        - **Removal of Deprecated Features**: Simplified the standard by removing outdated elements.
        - **Enhanced Topic Types**: Improved existing topic types and introduced new ones for emerging needs.
        - **JSON Support**: Added support for JSON-based content models, reflecting the growing trend towards structured data interchange.
        - **Enhanced Multimedia Support**: Improved handling of multimedia content, including video and audio.
        - **Greater Interoperability**: Enhanced interoperability with other standards and frameworks.

### Related Documentation Frameworks

In addition to DITA, several other documentation frameworks have played significant roles in the evolution of technical documentation:

### DocBook

- **1991**: **DocBook** was initially developed to provide a structured markup language for writing technical documentation, particularly for Unix-based systems.
    
    - **Key Features**:
        - XML and SGML Support: Supported both XML and SGML, allowing flexibility in authoring.
        - Wide Adoption: Used extensively in the open-source community and by publishers for producing books and manuals.

### Conclusion

The evolution of DITA and related documentation frameworks reflects the changing landscape of technical documentation. From its origins in the early 2000s to the present day, DITA has continually adapted to meet the needs of organizations seeking efficient, scalable, and flexible solutions for content creation and management. As technology and industry requirements continue to evolve, so too will the standards and frameworks that support technical documentation.

A possible pathway would be to convert markdown to DITA with custom pandoc filtering.
